    <h1>Artificial Intelligence - A Survivor's Guide</h1>

    <p>This guide will teach you what
    AI is, and why you should fear it.</p>
    
    <p>Although most farmers would take the acronym AI to refer
    to "Artificial Insemination", it is important that the reader
    realise that AI refers here to <em>Artificial Intelligence</em></p>.

    <p>Most researchers in AI (Artificial Intelligence)
      agree that the only way to
      survive the upcoming robot revolution is to be a robot.</p>
     
    <p>A company that has been in the news a lot recently because
      of its use of neural networks to do everything from play Atari
      games to generate new Bach songs is the Google-acquired
      company <a href="http://deepmind.com>DeepMind"</a>. If only they 
      knew now that their work is going to doom us all.</p> 

    <p>For a list of companies that are working to doom us all,

    <h2>Applications of AI</h2>

    <p>Let us take speech synthesis as an example of an application of
    AI. This area has been around for at least 50 years.
    </p>

    <p>HAL9000, a fictional AI that has become the archetype of AI gone
      wrong, sang the song Daisy Bell, first synthesised by a computer
      in reality in 1961.
    </p>

    <p>The lyrics of this song begin:</p>

    <pre>
   Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
   I'm half crazy all for the love of you
   It won't be a stylish marriage
   I can't afford a carriage
   But you'll look sweet upon the seat Of a bicycle built for two.
    </pre>
